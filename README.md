# Optimized Basis Functions for Kernel Ridge Regression
Demo of the method for optimized basis fuctions for kernel ridge regression.

See `sin_example.ipynb` for a practical demo.

### Requirements
Code is tested with:
* `python 3.5`
* `numpy`
* `keras` 2.0 (specifically with `theano` 0.9 backend but prepared to run with `tensorflow` too).
